## ⚡ Challenges Faced
1. **Dashboard Styling**  
   - Getting the layout to look balanced without Tailwind CSS.  
   - Solved by using clean **inline CSS** with proper spacing and alignment.  

2. **Navbar Design**  
   - Initially hard to center the logo while keeping notification and profile icons aligned.  
   - Final decision: kept logo left-aligned for better usability.  

3. **Challenge Card Buttons**  
   - Making Level 1 button active and Level 2 Be Locked.
